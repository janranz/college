## To actually do:
---

- Figure out how to self-invoke or call function to clear / reset fields upon page load. [ toggleDisable(); ]
- Set up results table. Since page is (hopefully) static, might need some way of refreshing table or a listener to display results. Start with figuring out what javascript:void(0) is *actually* doing in form action.
- Add feature for user to delete a class from storage. Add input for Class ID and search array.
- Consider a way to dump entire array (is the local storage used dealloc'd in some way?)
- Figure out formatting the table / form (CSS)
